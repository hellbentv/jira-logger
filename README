Dependency: SOAPpy

================
$./jira-log.py --help

  The tool will always display 'In Progress' cards so you don't have to use the GUI
  (you can also optionally show all your cards or insert a custom query)

  The provided comment will be parsed for a few internal strings
     bug #1234  --> creates a jira mark-up link to bugzilla.linaro.org
     review #34  --> creates a jira mark-up link to review.linaro.org
     log #1h  --> the tool will log 1 hour to the Card

  The target card to log work to and/or comment can be specified on the command line
  and/or parsed out of the local most-recent git commit message

usage: jira-log.py [-h] [--user USER] [--inprogress] [--allmycards]
                   [--query QUERY] [--issue ISSUE] [--comment COMMENT]
                   [--hours HOURS] [--debug]

This is a simple tool for logging work hours and adding comments to cards
